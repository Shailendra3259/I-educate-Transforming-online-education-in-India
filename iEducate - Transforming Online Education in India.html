     <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
          of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching,
           training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place

            under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can 
            take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the
             way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

        Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten,
         primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

     <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">  Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose i
         s teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms
          of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject.

           Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational 
           choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the 
           physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.[15][16]

        The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a 
        statistical base to compare education systems.[17] In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and
         25 fields, though the fields were later separated out to form a different project.

     <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
        deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and 
        through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to

         the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily 
         learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of
          the Middle Kingdom.

      Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.
       The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual
        cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE.
         European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.
